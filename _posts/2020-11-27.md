## Table transpose
of course we are not talking about normal mx transpose....
### ```pivot``` vs ```melt```
1. ```pivot``` transforms data in different columns into one volumns of label and one column of value. ```melt``` is the reverse operation of ```pivot```
2. ```pivot_table``` allows us to have a aggregate function when there are multiple values of that label.
### ```unstack``` vs ```stack```. which level of index can be selected
```stack``` is a special case of ```pivot```, put column names not in column but into another level of index, forming Multi-index table.  
```unstack``` otherwise, is the reverse of ```stack``` puting one level of index into column name

## Data transformation
### group by mapping
```groupby({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1})``` so that 'a' and 'c' are considered as the same group
### Iterate through groups to have some  operations...
### ```groupby().aggregate()```
1. apply different oeprations on all columns. ```groupby().aggregate([np.mean, 'min', max])
2. apply different operation on different columns by mapping. ```groupby().aggregate({'col1': func1, 'col2: func2})
### ```groupby().transform()```
must return a same dimensioned data as the original 
### ```groupby().apply()```
1. axis argument indicates how function goes forward. At each step, the function applies to the other axis.
2. apply method can return 'aggregate' like or 'transform' like results. It automatically interprets the results but we can also specify the format in result_type arguent
### ```groupby().filtering()```
```python
def func():
    return boolean #this has to be a boolean value
groupby().filter(func)
```

## Multi-index
## Indexing and selecting data
