title: iterable, iterator and generator
---

Generator implements the interface of iterator. Iterator pulls items from collections. So iterator can not be create from an infinite series but generator could create an infinite series of items.

The main purpose for generator and iterator are to lazily load a very large collection that can't fit into memory.

When se call functions like 'list', it automatically calls `iter()` function. So if the object didn't implement `__iter__` method, error will be raised.

A standard way to implement an interator is:

```python
class Iterator
```
