### logging
1. logging has 4 different thresholds to show infomations. DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL.
2. logging's structure is hierchical. ```root``` should be in the ```main```. each module has its own logger, added with handler(s)(files or console).
### logging module itself is the root. Some setting of methods can be done. for example:
```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) #this initiates a new logger for the current module.
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) # set logging threshold

file_handler = logging.fileHandler('sample.log')
file_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO) # lift file log threshold to INFO
file_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter()) #check attributes for Formatter in 'https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LogRecord'

stream_handler = logging.streamHandler()
stream_handler.setLevel(logging.WARNING) # if this not set, console will use DEBUG as level set in logger.
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
logger.addHandler(stream_handler)

try:
    result = do_something()
    logger.INFO('function done')
except Error:
    logger.exception('Error happened') #this will record the traceback in the log file and console
    raise Error # keeps the same error to be raised
```
